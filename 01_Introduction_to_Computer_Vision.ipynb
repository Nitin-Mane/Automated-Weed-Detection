    "# Introduction to Computer Vision using Intel oneAPI Analytical Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret, understand, and process visual data from the real world. It involves various algorithms and techniques to extract meaningful information from images and videos, making it particularly useful for applications such as object recognition, image segmentation, and scene understanding. One such application is crop weed classification and detection, where computer vision can help automate the process of identifying and removing weeds from agricultural fields, improving crop health and productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Computer Vision and Image Processing Techniques are important\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision is critical in various fields, including agriculture, as it helps automate processes that would otherwise be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Image processing techniques are essential for tasks like crop weed classification and detection because they allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enhance image quality and reduce noise, making it easier to identify and classify objects in the image.\n",
    "2. Segment the image into different regions, isolating areas of interest (e.g., crops and weeds) for further analysis.\n",
    "3. Extract features from the image that can be used as input for machine learning models, improving their accuracy and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intel oneAPI Analytical Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "The Intel oneAPI Analytical Toolkit is a comprehensive suite of software tools and libraries designed to enable developers to build high-performance, data-intensive applications across various domains, including computer vision. The toolkit provides optimized deep learning frameworks, libraries, and tools that accelerate the development and deployment of computer vision solutions on Intel hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TensorFlow with oneDNN and MKL Library\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning framework that supports deep learning and other numerical computations. The Intel oneAPI Analytical Toolkit extends TensorFlow's capabilities by integrating oneDNN (Deep Neural Network Library) and the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL). This integration enables developers to leverage Intel hardware optimizations for improved performance, reduced latency, and increased throughput when training and deploying deep learning models for computer vision tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology of Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with many layers, enabling them to learn complex patterns and representations from large datasets. In the context of crop weed classification and detection, we can use deep learning techniques to train models that can accurately identify and differentiate between crops and weeds in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data collection and preprocessing: Gather a large dataset of labeled images containing crops and weeds. Preprocess the data by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images to improve the model's generalization capabilities.\n",
    "2. Model selection and architecture: Choose a suitable deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and design the architecture with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.\n",
    "3. Training: Split the dataset into training and validation sets, and use the training set to train the model. Adjust the model's weights and biases using backpropagation and optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam.\n",
    "4. Evaluation: Validate the model's performance on the validation set, using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters as needed to improve its performance.\n",
    "5. Deployment: Integrate the trained model into a real-world application for crop weed classification and detection, such as a robotic weeding system or an agricultural drone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ResNet50 and ResNet101\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet (Residual Network) is a popular deep learning architecture developed by Microsoft Research that has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various computer vision tasks, including image classification and object detection. The key innovation behind ResNet is the use of residual connections (or skip connections) that allow the network to learn residual functions, effectively addressing the vanishing gradient problem and enabling the training of much deeper networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet50 and ResNet101 are two variants of the ResNet architecture, with 50 and 101 layers, respectively. Both models have been pre-trained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, providing excellent feature extraction capabilities that can be leveraged for transfer learning in other computer vision tasks, such as crop weed classification and detection. By using these pre-trained models as a starting point and fine-tuning the weights with domain-specific data, developers can achieve high performance with relatively less training data and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ResNet50 and ResNet101: Deep Learning Architecture and Learning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet50 and ResNet101 are deep learning architectures that belong to the Residual Network (ResNet) family. As mentioned earlier, they consist of 50 and 101 layers, respectively, and utilize residual connections (or skip connections) to address the vanishing gradient problem, which commonly occurs in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of both ResNet50 and ResNet101 can be divided into four main building blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial Convolutional Block: This block consists of a single convolutional layer with a large filter size (usually 7x7) and stride (usually 2x2), followed by a max-pooling layer. This initial block helps reduce the input image's spatial dimensions while enhancing the feature representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Residual Blocks: These are the core components of ResNet architectures, and they consist of multiple blocks, each containing multiple convolutional layers with small filter sizes (usually 3x3). Residual connections (skip connections) are introduced between these layers to allow the network to learn residual functions, which helps in training deeper networks without facing the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bottleneck Blocks: In ResNet50 and ResNet101, bottleneck blocks are used within the residual blocks to reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity. Bottleneck blocks replace the standard residual blocks with three layers â€“ a 1x1 convolution, a 3x3 convolution, and another 1x1 convolution. This design helps in reducing the number of parameters and enhancing computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Classification Block: The final part of the architecture is a global average pooling layer, followed by a fully connected layer with a softmax activation function. This block generates the final output probabilities for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrated Model using ResNet\n",
    "The provided model architecture employs a pre-trained ResNet (either ResNet50 or ResNet101) as a feature extractor (keras_layer). This layer outputs a 2048-dimensional feature vector which is then fed into a series of fully connected (Dense) layers, Dropout layers, and finally, a softmax activation for binary classification (two classes - crops and weeds).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief description of the custom layers added on top of the pre-trained ResNet:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Dense` layers: These are fully connected layers with varying numbers of neurons (1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32) and ReLU activation functions. These layers serve as classifiers that learn to differentiate between the crops and weeds based on the extracted features from the ResNet layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Dropout` layers: These layers are used for regularizing the network, reducing overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training. This helps the model generalize better on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Dense_6` layer: This is the final output layer with two neurons and a softmax activation function. It provides the probabilities for each class (crops and weeds).\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating a pre-trained ResNet as the feature extractor and customizing the classifier, the model can leverage the powerful feature extraction capabilities of ResNet and adapt to the specific application of crop weed classification and detection. The total number of parameters in the model is 45,403,106, out of which 2,797,602 are trainable (custom layers), and the remaining 42,605,504 are non-trainable (pre-trained ResNet).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach, known as transfer learning, allows the model to benefit from the pre-existing knowledge of the base ResNet architecture while fine-tuning the classifier to the specific task of crop weed detection. As a result, the training process is faster, requires less data, and often leads to better performance than training a deep learning model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
